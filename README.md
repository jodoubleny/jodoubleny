# Bangawoyo!üëã
Glad to meet you! I'm ***Jonny***, a full stack web developer based in Toronto üá®üá¶.
I still remember the moment I created my very first website with Microsoft FrontPage when I was young.
I was drawn to and fascinated by the early era of web technology from then.
Over the years, web technology has significantly changed, but my passion and love for it haven't diminished.
I believe the infinite possibility of the web that has a positive impact on our society by bridging the virtual environment and real life.
